    abstract  ="Dye-sensitized solar cells (DSCs) have drawn significant interest due to their low production cost{,} design flexibility{,} and the tunability of the sensitizer. However{,} the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the metal-free organic dyes is limited due to the inability of the dye to absorb light in the near-infrared (NIR) region{,} leaving a large amount of energy unused. Herein{,} we have designed new DSC dyes with open-shell character{,} which significantly red-shifts the absorption spectra from their counterpart closed-shell structure. A small diradical character (\textit{y} < 0.10) is found to be beneficial in red-shifting the absorption maxima into the NIR region and broadening up to 2500 nm. Also{,} the open-shell dyes significantly reduce the singlet-triplet energy gaps ($\Delta$\textit{E}$_{ST}$){,} increase the total amount of charge-transfer to the semiconductor surface{,} reduce the exciton binding energy{,} and significantly increase the excited-state lifetimes compared to the closed-shell systems. However{,} the closed-shell dyes have higher injection efficiency with increased intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) character. Our study reveals the design rule for open-shell DSC dyes to be able to absorb photons in the NIR region{,} which can increase the efficiency of the solar cell device."}

    abstract = {The aqueous phase hydrogenation of furfural to cyclopentanone was investigated using carbon supported Pd-Cu catalysts prepared by various methods. The most active and selective Pd-Cu catalysts were obtained using electroless plating procedure of deposition of copper in the presence of tartrate carboxylate ligands. It is an alternative and promising way to deposit metal nanoparticles onto the surfaces of porous solid supports. As the XRD data revealed in these catalysts beside metallic palladium with the particle sizes 6.8nm the copper exist mainly in Cu<sup>+</sup> oxidation state as Cu<inf>2</inf>O and the metallic copper is practically absent. The selectivity to cyclopentanone was enhanced gradually by the addition of 3, 5 and 10wt% of copper precursor on the pre-reduced 5%Pd/C catalyst. An appropriate Pd<sup>0</sup> and Cu<sup>+</sup> distribution is presumed to be a key in gaining excellent catalytic activity. Under reaction conditions where mass-transfer effects were eliminated the furfural conversion about 98% and cyclopentanone yield 92.1mol% were achieved using only 1wt% concentration of 5%Pd-10%Cu/C catalyst and reaction time 1h. According to the proposed mechanism the dominant parameters responsible for reaching very high selectivity of cyclopentanone are (i) very high yield of primary formed furfuryl alcohol and (ii) higher rate of its subsequent conversion to cyclopentanone via the pathway not involving 4-hydroxy-2-cyclopentenone as the main intermediate.},

Nonalcoholic and non-polar solvents caused a drastic activity decrease. When used in consecutive hydrogenation reactions, the bimetallic catalysts showed a certain deactivation (25% between the first and third cycle), but still they were very selective to furfuryl alcohol.

    abstract = {Biomass conversion to fuels and chemicals provides sustainability, but the highly oxygenated nature of a large fraction of biomass-derived molecules requires removal of the excess oxygen and partial hydrogenation in the upgrade, typically met by hydrodeoxygenation processes. Catalytic transfer hydrogenation is a general approach in accomplishing this with renewable organic hydrogen donors, but mechanistic understanding is currently lacking. Here, we elucidate the molecular level reaction pathway of converting hemicellulose-derived furfural to 2-methylfuran on a bifunctional Ru/RuOx/C catalyst using isopropyl alcohol as the hydrogen donor via a combination of isotopic labeling and kinetic studies. Hydrogenation of the carbonyl group of furfural to furfuryl alcohol proceeds through a Lewis acid-mediated intermolecular hydride transfer and hydrogenolysis of furfuryl alcohol occurs mainly via ring-activation involving both metal and Lewis acid sites. Our results show that the bifunctional nature of the catalyst is critical in the efficient hydrodeoxygenation of furanics and provides insights toward the rational design of such catalysts.},

The implicit solvation model follows the framework of joint density functional theory. We describe the framework, our algorithm and implementation, and benchmarks for small molecular systems. We apply the solvation model to study the surface energies of different facets of semiconducting and metallic nanocrystals and the SN2 reaction pathway. We find that solvation reduces the surface energies of the nanocrystals, especially for the semiconducting ones and increases the energy barrier of the SN2 reaction. {\textcopyright} 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.},

Like the LAPW method it can be used to treat first-row and transition-metal elements with affordable effort and provides access to the full wave function. The augmentation procedure is generalized in that partial-wave expansions are not determined by the value and the derivative of the envelope function at some muffin-tin radius, but rather by the overlap with localized projector functions. The pseudopotential approach based on generalized separable pseudopotentials can be regained by a simple approximation. {\textcopyright} 1994 The American Physical Society.},

Grid-search methods are the standard numerical approximations used to find the optimal values of the free parameters, making the computational complexity to scale with the number of points in the grid. In this report, we illustrate that Bayesian optimization (BO), a sample-efficient machine learning algorithm, can calibrate different density functional models, e.g., hybrid exchange-correlation and range-separated density functionals. Using the atomization energies and bond lengths from the Gaussian-1 (G1) and Gaussian-2 (G2) databases, we show that BO optimizes the free parameters of the hybrid exchange-correlation functionals with approximately 55 evaluations of the error function. We also show that selecting exchange-correlation functionals for different physical systems can be done with BO. We jointly optimize and select the form of the exchange-correlation functionals and the free parameters by minimizing the root-mean-square error functions for the G1 and G2 data set atomization energies. The calibrated DF model is more accurate on average than standard DF methods, e.g., PBE0 and B3LYP.},

Improved performance for the adsorption of water on salt is also obtained. {\textcopyright} 2009 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

    abstract = {The van der Waals density functional (vdW-DF) of M. Dion [Phys. Rev. Lett.PRLTAO0031-900710.1103/PhysRevLett.92.246401 92, 246401 (2004)] is a promising approach for including dispersion in approximate density functional theory exchange-correlation functionals. Indeed, an improved description of systems held by dispersion forces has been demonstrated in the literature. However, despite many applications, standard general tests on a broad range of materials including traditional "hard" matter such as metals, ionic compounds, and insulators are lacking. Such tests are important not least because many of the applications of the vdW-DF method focus on the adsorption of atoms and molecules on the surfaces of solids. Here we calculate the lattice constants, bulk moduli, and atomization energies for a range of solids using the original vdW-DF and several of its offspring. We find that the original vdW-DF overestimates lattice constants in a similar manner to how it overestimates binding distances for gas-phase dimers. However, some of the modified vdW functionals lead to average errors which are similar to those of PBE or better. Likewise, atomization energies that are slightly better than from PBE are obtained from the modified vdW-DFs. Although the tests reported here are for hard solids, not normally materials for which dispersion forces are thought to be important, we find a systematic improvement in cohesive properties for the alkali metals and alkali halides when nonlocal correlations are accounted for. {\textcopyright} 2011 American Physical Society.},

It satisfies the constraints used to construct the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional but can be systematically varied using one parameter called $\alpha$. This gives the possibility to estimate the reliability of a computational result or to fit the parameter for a certain problem. Compared to other semiempirical functionals, the present has the advantage of using only one physically transparent parameter and the fitted functional will obey the same exact conditions as PBE functional. One functional is constructed by fixing $\alpha$ using the exchange enhancement for the slowly varying electron gas. This functional is free of empirical parameters and gives good results for densely packed solids. The simple form of the exchange enhancement means that oscillating terms in the exchange potential are avoided. {\textcopyright} 2007 The American Physical Society.},

We term the resulting functional PBE+rVV10L, with the "L" indicating that it is for layered materials. Such a combination is not new, and only involves refitting a single global parameter. However, the resulting excellent accuracy suggests such a dispersion-corrected PBE for many aspects of theoretical studies on layered materials.

The PBE ionization potentials, electron affinities, and bond lengths are of accuracy similar to those obtained from empirical functionals. Furthermore, a recently proposed hybrid scheme using exact exchange together with PBE exchange and correlation is investigated.

    abstract = {Bimetallic phosphides are promising materials for biomass valorization, yet many metal combinations are understudied as catalysts and require further analysis to realize their superior properties. Herein, we provide the synthesis, characterization, and catalytic performance of a variety of period 4 and 5 solid solutions of molybdenum-based bimetallic phosphides (MMoP, M = Fe, Co, Ni, Ru). From the results, the charge sharing between the metals and phosphorus control the relative oxidation of Mo and reduction of P in the lattice, which were both indirectly observed in binding energy shifts in X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and absorption energy shifts in X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES). For MMoP (M = Fe, Co, Ni), the more oxidized the Mo in the bimetallic phosphide, the higher the selectivity to benzene from phenol via direct deoxygenation at 400 °C and 750 psig. This phenomenon was observed in the bimetallic materials synthesized across period 4, where aromatic selectivity and degree of Mo oxidation both decreased in the following order FeMoP ≫ CoMoP > NiMoP. Alternatively, in the case of MMoP (M = Fe, Ru), the P in RuMoP is more oxidized compared to that in FeMoP, and the selectivity toward the hydrogenation pathway increased due to the interaction between the aromatic rings and the P species on the surface. For RuMoP and NiMoP, cyclohexanol was selectively produced from phenol with >99% selectivity when the reaction temperature was lowered to 125 °C at 750 psig, whereas FeMoP and CoMoP were not active under these conditions. Last, complete deoxygenation of phenol to benzene, cyclohexane, and cyclohexene was accomplished using mixtures of RuMoP and FeMoP in flow and batch experiments. These results highlight the versatility and wide applicability of transition metal phosphides for biomass conversions.},

    abstract = {The development of task-specific bimetallic phosphide catalysts can be accomplished by exploiting the electronic and bi-functional effects of multiple metal combinations, thus providing materials with tunable catalytic properties. Here, we present the modulation of metal compositions (i.e., Fe and Mo) in the synthesis of FeXMo2-XP (0.88 ≤ X ≤ 1.55), leading to a series of iso-structural, orthorhombic FeXMo2-XP catalysts via reduction at 750 °C. Hydrodeoxygenation of phenol was selected as a probe reaction to showcase the effect of metal composition on the catalytic performance. In particular, catalysts with Fe compositions between 0.99 and 1.14 (i.e., Fe0.99Mo1.01P and Fe1.14Mo0.86P) exhibited high selectivities to C-O bond cleavage of phenol with H2 to form benzene. The catalysts with the highest selectivities to C-O scission also exhibited the highest acidity as determined from NH3 temperature programmed desorption experiments. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate the high Lewis acidity for the ∼1:1 Fe:Mo compositions resulted from a greater charge separation between metallic species and P species. These compositions led to greater selectivities to benzene due to desired coordination environment of the phenol on catalytic surface, as evidenced by both DFT calculations and a time on stream study using a benzonitrile poison. Enhanced TOFs were also observed with catalysts exhibiting greater Lewis acid character, which reduce the activation energy required to cleave the C-O bond of phenol, as evidenced by DFT calculations. This structure-property study highlights the effects of metal composition in bimetallic phosphides to enhance the activity and selectivity for C-O bond cleavage reactions.},

Bimetallic catalysts offer the potential of increased activities and selectivities for desired products. Adding non-metallic elements, such as phosphorous, allows for charge distribution between the metal and nonmetal atoms, which improves Lewis acid character of catalytic surfaces. This work utilizes experimental and density functional theory (DFT) based calculations to identify potential C-O bond cleavage pathways and product selectivities for HDO reactions on FeMoP, RuMoP, and NiMoP catalysts. Our work demonstrates that FeMoP catalyst favors direct deoxygenation pathway due to a lower activation energy barrier for C-O bond cleavage whereas RuMoP and NiMoP catalysts promote ring hydrogenation first, followed by the cleavage of C-O bond. The Bader charge analysis indicates that for these catalytic systems Mo$\delta$+ site bears a large positive charge which acts as a Lewis acid site for HDO reactions. Overall, we find that trends in the experimental product selectivities are in good agreement with that predicted with DFT calculations.},

With a metallic Ru/C catalyst, a selectivity of ∼30% was achieved. The promotion of the Ru/C catalyst with the Lewis acid RuOx resulted in a selectivity of ∼80%. In the current study, we employ density functional theory calculations on the RuO2 (110) surface in order to elucidate the role of the Lewis acidity in the reduction of the biomass-derived furfuryl alcohol to 2-methylfuran. We identify the rate-limiting step to be the scission of the C-O bond of the side chain. In addition, we find evidence for the activation of the furan ring via an insertion of a hydrogen atom. However, the Lewis basicity of a neighboring bridging oxygen results in the furan ring being deactivated. Finally, the formation of water from the reduction process is facile. However, owing to the strong binding energy between the RuO2 surface and the water molecule, poisoning of the catalytic surface by adsorbed water is possible. Finally, we show that the RuO2 (110) carries out the reduction of furfural to furfuryl alcohol via the Meerwin-Ponndorf-Verley (MPV) reaction fairly easily, consistent with published experimental data.},

Interestingly, an obvious composition-dependent catalytic performance was observed: upon incrementally increasing the proportion of Ag in PdAg NPs, the hydrogenation selectivity can transform from tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol (sel. 94% for Pd4Ag1/C) to furfuryl alcohol (sel. 95% for Pd1Ag1/C) with nearly complete conversion (99%) of furfural. DFT calculations revealed that the adsorption free energy of in situ generated furfuryl alcohol on Pd(111) surface is inversely proportional correlated with the Ag content in PdAg bimetallic NPs, which accounts for the alteration of chemoselectivity. Importantly, the present study is the first demonstration of composition-induced selectivity reversal for the hydrogenation of furfural under ambient conditions (25 °C, 0.1 MPa H2).},

The results are discussed in relation to modern views on catalytic activity and the high yield of tetrahydrofuran is thought to be connected with not an optimum lattice dimension, but the almost complete filling of the d-levels of nickel which occurs at about 44 nickel-copper.

    abstract = {Biomass has received considerable attention as a sustainable feedstock that can replace diminishing fossil fuels for the production of energy, especially for the transportation sector. The overall strategy in the production of hydrocarbon fuels from biomass is (i) to reduce the substantial oxygen content of the parent feedstock to improve energy density and (ii) to create C–C bonds between biomass-derived intermediates to increase the molecular weight of the final hydrocarbon product. We begin this review with a brief overview of first-generation biofuels, specifically bioethanol and biodiesel. We consider the implications of utilizing starchy and triglyceride feedstocks from traditional food crops, and we provide an overview of second-generation technologies to process the major constituents of more abundant lignocellulosic biomass, such as thermochemical routes (gasification, pyrolysis, liquefaction) which directly process whole lignocellulose to upgradeable platforms (e.g., synthesis gas and bio-oil). The primary focus of this review is an overview of catalytic strategies to produce biofuels from aqueous solutions of carbohydrates, which are isolated through biomass pretreatment and hydrolysis. Although hydrolysis-based platforms are associated with higher upstream costs arising from pretreatment and hydrolysis, the aqueous solutions of biomass-derived compounds can be processed selectively to yield hydrocarbons with targeted molecular weights and structures. For example, sugars can be used as reforming feedstocks for the production of renewable hydrogen, or they can be dehydrated to yield furfurals or levulinic acid. For each of the platforms discussed, we have suggested relevant strategies for the formation of C–C bonds, such as aldol condensation of ketones and oligomerization of alkenes, to enable the production of gasoline, jet, and Diesel fuel range hydrocarbons. Finally, we address the importance of hydrogen in biorefining and discuss strategies for managing its consumption to ensure independence from fossil fuels. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

    abstract = {In this paper we present a new process to produce furfural and co-products of formic and acetic acids from waste aqueous hemicellulose solutions using a continuous two zone biphasic reactor. We estimate this approach uses 67% to 80% less energy than the current industrial processes to produce furfural. An economic analysis indicates that furfural can be produced with this process at 366 US$ per metric ton which is 25% of the selling price of furfural in the U.S. market today. This analysis assumes a plant capacity of 78 kiloton per year of furfural, 12 kiloton per year of formic acid and 44 kiloton per year of acetic acid (processing 160 ton per hour of hemicellulose solutions with a xylose concentration of 10.7 wt%) and is based on the data collected in this paper. Formic acid and acetic acid are probably produced from the acid hydrolysis of formylated and acetylated xylose oligomers, respectively. Furfural is produced in a two-step process consisting of the hydrolysis of xylose oligomers followed by the dehydration of xylose monomers and then extraction of the furfural into an organic solvent. Two types of hemicellulose solutions were used as the feedstock including a hot water extract and a green liquor extract derived from Northeastern hardwood trees. The hemicellulose solution contains mainly xylose oligomers as well as glucose, arabinose, lactic acid, acetic acid, formic acid, and other minor products. We found that the reaction temperature, the space velocity, the volumetric organic to aqueous phase ratio, and the acid concentration have significant effects on the furfural production. Under the optimized condition, a furfural yield of 90% can be achieved in the reactor from the hot water extract containing 10.7 wt% xylose. A conceptual design is performed for the integration of the production of furfural, formic and acetic acids, the liquid-liquid split, and subsequent three-stage distillations. We demonstrate that high purity (>99%) of furfural, formic and acetic acids can be obtained, with a final recovery of more than 97%, 56%, and 88% of the furfural, formic acid and acetic acid, respectively. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

    abstract = {This critical review provides a survey illustrated by recent references of different strategies to achieve a sustainable conversion of biomass to bioproducts. Because of the huge number of chemical products that can be potentially manufactured, a selection of starting materials and targeted chemicals has been done. Also, thermochemical conversion processes such as biomass pyrolysis or gasification as well as the synthesis of biofuels were not considered. The synthesis of chemicals by conversion of platform molecules obtained by depolymerisation and fermentation of biopolymers is presently the most widely envisioned approach. Successful catalytic conversion of these building blocks into intermediates, specialties and fine chemicals will be examined. However, the platform molecule value chain is in competition with well-optimised, cost-effective synthesis routes from fossil resources to produce chemicals that have already a market. The literature covering alternative value chains whereby biopolymers are converted in one or few steps to functional materials will be analysed. This approach which does not require the use of isolated, pure chemicals is well adapted to produce high tonnage products, such as paper additives, paints, resins, foams, surfactants, lubricants, and plasticisers. Another objective of the review was to examine critically the green character of conversion processes because using renewables as raw materials does not exempt from abiding by green chemistry principles (368 references). {\textcopyright} 2012 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

    abstract = {From a biophysical perspective, woody biomass resources are large enough to cover a substantial share of the world's primary energy consumption in 2050. However, these resources have alternative uses and their accessibility is limited, which tends to decrease their competitiveness with respect to other forms of energy. Hence, the key question of woody biomass use for energy is not the amount of resources, but rather their price. In this study we consider the question from the perspective of energy wood supply curves, which display the available amount of woody biomass for large-scale energy production at various hypothetical energy wood prices. These curves are estimated by the Global Biosphere Management Model (GLOBIOM), which is a global partial equilibrium model of forest and agricultural sectors. The global energy wood supply is estimated to be 0-23Gm3/year (0-165EJ/year) when energy wood prices vary in a range of 0-30$/GJ (0-216$/m3). If we add household fuelwood to energy wood, then woody biomass could satisfy 2-18% of world primary energy consumption in 2050. If primary forests are excluded from wood supply then the potential decreases up to 25%. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

This work investigates the fabrication costs and coupled thermal and electrical transport factors that govern device efficiency and commercial feasibility of the most promising thermoelectric materials. For 30 bulk and thin film thermoelectric materials, we quantify the tradeoff between efficiency and cost considering electrical and thermal transport at the system level, raw material prices, system component costs, and estimated manufacturing costs. This work neglects the cost of heat, as appropriate for most waste-heat recovery applications, and applies a power generation cost metric in $/W and a cooling operating cost metric in $/kWh. The results indicate material costs are too high for typical thermoelectric power generation applications at mean temperatures below 135 1C. Above 275 1C, many bulk thermoelectric materials can achieve costs below $1/W. The major barrier to economical thermoelectric power generation at these higher temperatures results from system costs for heat exchangers and ceramic plates. For cooling applications, we find that several thermoelectric materials can be cost competitive and commercially promising.},

At suitable Fe-content (XFe), the Ni-Fe-B amorphous catalyst exhibited much higher activity than the corresponding undoped Ni-B in the liquid phase hydrogenation of furfural (FFR) to furfuryl alcohol (FFA). With the increase of XFe, the activity first increased and then decreased while the selectivity to FFA changed in a contrast way. The Fe-B amorphous alloy itself was inactive for the FFR hydrogenation. The optimum XFe, was determined as 0.51, at which the FFA yield reached 100% after reaction for 4 h. Based on various characterizations, the promoting effect of the Fe-dopant was discussed by considering (1) the increase in the surface area, more highly unsaturated Ni active sites, and the more homogeneous distribution of the Ni active sites owing to the presence of Fe 2O3 as a dopant; (2) the affinity of the Fe3+ for the oxygen in the carbonyl group which strengthened the adsorption of the C=O bond by the catalyst and thus facilitated its hydrogenation; (3) the electron donation of the metallic Fe to the metallic Ni, making Fe electron-deficient while Ni electron-enriched which activated the C=O bond towards the hydrogenation. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

Their catalytic properties were evaluated using liquid phase furfural hydrogenation to furfuryl alcohol as the probe reaction. It was found that the reaction media had no significant influence on either the amorphous structure of the Co-B catalyst or the electronic interaction between metallic Co and alloying B. This could successfully account for the fact that all the as-prepared Co-B catalysts exhibited almost the same selectivity to furfuryl alcohol and the same activity per surface area (RHS), which could be considered as the intrinsic activity, since the nature of active sites remained unchanged. However, the activity per gram of Co (RHm) of the as-prepared Co-B catalysts increased rapidly when the ethanol content in the water-ethanol mixture used as the reaction medium for catalyst preparation increased. This could be attributed to the rapid increase in the surface area possibly owing to the presence of more oxidized boron species which could serve as a support for dispersing the Co-B amorphous alloy particles. {\textcopyright} 2006 SIOC, CAS, & Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

    abstract = {A Ce-doped Ni-B amorphous catalyst (Ni-Ce-B) was prepared by chemical reduction of mixed NiCl2 and CeSO4 with KBH4 in aqueous solution. During liquid-phase hydrogenation of furfural (FFR), all the as-prepared Ni-Ce-B amorphous catalyst exhibited excellent selectivity to furfural alcohol (FFA) owing to the unique amorphous structure and the electronic interaction between the metallic Ni and the alloying B. With the increase of the Ce dopant, the activity first increased and then decreased. The optimum Ce/(Ce+Ni) molar ratio (XCe) was determined as 1.28%. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) spectra revealed that most of the Ce species in the Ni-Ce-B sample were present in the form of Ce2O 3. On one hand, the Ce2O3 might serve as a support for the Ni-B amorphous alloy particles, resulting in the higher surface areas (SBET). On the other hand, the Ce2O3 might serve as a Lewis acid which could strongly adsorb and further polarize the C=O group in the FFR molecule. These two factors could successfully account for the promoting effect of the Ce dopant on the hydrogenation activity of the Ni-B amorphous alloy. Very high content of the Ce dopant (XCe>1.28%) resulted in the decrease of the hydrogenation activity because too many Ni active sites were covered by Ce2O3 species. Treatment of the Ni-Ce-B catalyst at high temperature also caused a decrease in activity due to the transformation from the amorphous structure to the crystalline structure and the loss of the surface area. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Bimetallic catalysts offer the potential of increased activities and selectivities for desired products. Adding non-metallic elements, such as phosphorous, allows for charge distribution between the metal and nonmetal atoms, which improves Lewis acid character of catalytic surfaces. This work utilizes experimental and density functional theory (DFT) based calculations to identify potential C-O bond cleavage pathways and product selectivities for HDO reactions on FeMoP, RuMoP, and NiMoP catalysts. Our work demonstrates that FeMoP catalyst favors direct deoxygenation pathway due to a lower activation energy barrier for C-O bond cleavage whereas RuMoP and NiMoP catalysts promote ring hydrogenation first, followed by the cleavage of C-O bond. The Bader charge analysis indicates that for these catalytic systems Mo$\delta$+ site bears a large positive charge which acts as a Lewis acid site for HDO reactions. Overall, we find that trends in the experimental product selectivities are in good agreement with that predicted with DFT calculations.},

It was found that the dissociative bidentate bridging mode is the most stable adsorption configuration on the TiO2 anatase (101) surface for DCRD. The calculated results indicate that in contrast to dyes with a CA group{,} the DCRD anchor group-based dye has a red-shifted absorption spectrum{,} which is beneficial for the enhancement of Jsc. However{,} the S atom in the DCRD group near the semiconductor surface has strong interactions with I2{,} which could lead to a higher I2 concentration in the vicinity of the dye-coated TiO2 surface{,} accelerating interfacial charge recombination. To avoid such shortcomings{,} a further optimization strategy for DCRD-based dyes was also proposed from a theoretical point of view. More importantly{,} we anticipate that dyes with the DCRD anchor group could show better performance in iodine-free redox shuttles-based DSSCs{,} in which the dyeâI2 interaction could be avoided."}

The software, written in ANSI C, originates from a parallel hardware project, and is well suited for parallelization on processor clusters. By careful optimization of neighbor searching and of inner loop performance, GROMACS is a very fast program for molecular dynamics simulation. It does not have a force field of its own, but is compatible with GROMOS, OPLS, AMBER},

    abstract = "A parallel message-passing implementation of a molecular dynamics (MD) program that is useful for bio(macro)molecules in aqueous environment is described. The software has been developed for a custom-designed 32-processor ring GROMACS (GROningen MAchine for Chemical Simulation) with communication to and from left and right neighbours, but can run on any parallel system onto which a a ring of processors can be mapped and which supports PVM-like block send and receive calls. The GROMACS software consists of a preprocessor, a parallel MD and energy minimization program that can use an arbitrary number of processors (including one), an optional monitor, and several analysis tools. The programs are written in ANSI C and available by ftp (information: gromacs@chem.rug.nl). The functionality is based on the GROMOS (GROningen MOlecular Simulation) package (van Gunsteren and Berendsen, 1987; BIOMOS B.V., Nijenborgh 4, 9747 AG Groningen). Conversion programs between GROMOS and GROMACS formats are included. The MD program can handle rectangular periodic boundary conditions with temperature and pressure scaling. The interactions that can be handled without modification are variable non-bonded pair interactions with Coulomb and Lennard-Jones or Buckingham potentials, using a twin-range cut-off based on charge groups, and fixed bonded interactions of either harmonic or constraint type for bonds and bond angles and either periodic or cosine power series interactions for dihedral angles. Special forces can be added to groups of particles (for non-equilibrium dynamics or for position restraining) or between particles (for distance restraints). The parallelism is based on particle decomposition. Interprocessor communication is largely limited to position and force distribution over the ring once per time step."

Hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of phenol was used as the model reaction to examine the effect of the catalyst structure on the hydrogenolysis and hydrogenation activity and selectivity. The unsupported MoS2, with amorphous and highly bent multi-layer structures, was much more active than the highly crystalline structured MoS2 and resulted in direct oxygen elimination. Co promoter showed a strong effect on the activity and selectivity of Mo sulfides. Temperature programmed reduction (TPR) exhibited the close interaction between Co and Mo in the bimetallic sulfide catalysts resulting in shift of TPR peaks to lower temperatures. The addition of promoter also affected the textural properties of amorphous Mo sulfide by decreasing the surface area, changing the pore characteristics and shifting the pore-size distribution towards smaller sizes. The growth of MoS2 crystallized particles was inhibited when Co was incorporated. The enhanced catalytic activity observed with the promoter addition was essentially due to the enhancement of the rate of direct-deoxygenation route. The present study indicated that the activity and selectivity for phenol HDO can be controlled by tailoring the morphology and the promoter of the unsupported MoS2 catalysts."

Many studies have suggested that transition metal phosphides could be ideal catalysts due to their low cost, abundance, and high efficiency. In many areas, TMPs can be applied as stable and efficient catalytic materials. Therefore, many kinds of TMPs are designed and synthesized by different methods. This article has summarized the recent research progress of TMPs, including their preparation methods and morphologies. Moreover, the application and catalytic performance of TMPs in different catalytic fields are further elaborated, and views on the opportunities and challenges faced by phosphide catalysts are presented.},

    abstract = {Metal carbides, phosphides, and nitrides provide a significant opportunity for catalyst tuning by choice of ligand and composition. With new methods of preparation that reduce synthesis temperature and control particle growth, these materials are now available as well dispersed, high surface area nanoparticles. These breakthroughs have led to their application as alternative catalysts for the hydrodeoxygenation (HDO) of bio-oil, a key technology for future biorefineries. The new catalysts have high activity and selectivity for HDO, but because they are oxophilic, O adsorption occurs during reaction. Recent studies show that the specific activity of Mo2C does not change significantly as a consequence of O adsorption; whereas, HDO selectivity decreases as the metallic character of the Mo is reduced in the presence of O. Similar studies are needed to assess the impact of O on metal phosphides and nitrides, while the activity of these materials in the presence of the many components present in bio-oil remains to be determined.},

Etherification is classified into two methods such as reductive etherification and direct etherification. A previous study showed that ethers containing shorter alkyl chains increase the octane number of fuels. Ethers containing longer alkyl chains enhanced the cetane number of diesel fuel. The etherification of furfural and its derivatives hold particular promise for the production of fuel additives. There are two strategies to produce furanic ethers: (1) the conversion of furfural to furfuryl alcohol or acetal followed by etherification and (2) the etherification of furfuryl alcohol (FFA), occasionally known as direct etherification. Both strategies require an acid catalyst. The conversion of furfuryl alcohol to furfuryl ethers was influenced by Br{\o}nsted or Lewis acid. The synthesis of methylfurans, which has higher research octane number than gasoline, is also described.},

The primary objective of this work is to present established and emerging energy conversion opportunities that can transform the treatment of livestock waste from a liability to a profit center. While biological production of methanol and hydrogen are in early research stages, anaerobic digestion is an established method of generating between 0.1 to 1.3 m3 m-3 d-1 of methane-rich biogas. The TCC processes of pyrolysis, direct liquefaction, and gasification can convert waste into gaseous fuels, combustible oils, and charcoal. Integration of biological and thermal-based conversion technologies in a farm-scale hybrid design by combining an algal CO2-fixation treatment requiring less than 27,000 m2 of treatment area with the energy recovery component of wet gasification can drastically reduce CO2 emissions and efficiently recycle nutrients. These designs have the potential to make future large scale confined animal feeding operations sustainable and environmentally benign while generating on-farm renewable energy.},

Management of the mineral acids used in pretreatment steps remains a challenge, but proper organic solvent selection, such as 2-sec-butylphenol, allows for complete recovery and recycle of mineral acid. Using solvents with high partition coefficients for extraction of products in biphasic unit operations allows the concentrations of products to be increased and improves the efficiency of downstream processing options, such as distillation or further upgrading reactions. Overall, fractionation of lignocellulosic biomass allows for a flexible, integrated processing approach that we hope will advance biorefining operations, allowing commercial biomass processing to become a reality. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

The various production routes are critically reviewed, and the needs for improvements are identified. Their relative industrial potential is analysed by defining an investment index and CO2 emissions as well as determining the fuel properties for the resulting products. Finally, the most promising candidate, 2-methylfuran, was subjected to a road trial of 90 000 km in a gasoline blend. Importantly, the potential of the furfural platform relies heavily on the cost-competitive production of furfural from lignocellulosic feedstock. Conventional standalone and emerging coproduct processes-for example, as a coproduct of cellulosic ethanol, levulinic acid or hydroxymethyl furfural-are expensive and energetically demanding. Challenges and areas that need improvement are highlighted. In addition to providing a critical review of the literature, this paper also presents new results and analysis in this area.

Some upgrade pathways promise to deliver blending components with excellent fuel properties at moderate upgrade cost and CO2 emission.

Therefore, promoting renewables in this sector is vital to move Europe towards a low-carbon economy. Since solid biomass is the only renewable with significant industrial use, it is crucial to know the status of its present use and to analyze the prospects of its future utilization by the industry. The current European industrial energy consumption is reviewed, with a focus on bioheat. The available solid biomass feedstock and energy conversion alternatives are examined, along with future perspectives for further biomass consumption in several industrial sectors. Defining global strategies for industrial heat is not easy because of the diversity of industrial processes. Combustion dominates industrial heat production from biomass, but gasification systems are already commercially available. Combined heat and power production is mainly based on steam cycles. The full temperature range required by industry can be attained with biomass efficiently. The use of biomass-fired systems is generalized in the industries that generate solid biomass by-products, but the implementation of additional, more efficient and alternative biomass uses should be sought. Biomass penetration into sectors with no own biomass resources is more difficult. Major barriers are the high investment costs of biomass systems, strong competition with fossil fuels, and feedstock availability and security of supply. Although Europe's solid biomass production and consumption are almost balanced, the pressure on resources is increasing. Therefore, it is important that resources are monitored and that sustainability is taken into consideration.},

    abstract = {With the rise in global energy demand and environmental awareness, the need to replace fossil fuels with renewable alternatives is now acknowledged. Among several products that can be obtained from lignocellulose biomass, furfural is one of the members of the furanics class, which also encompasses a group of molecules that include 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, 2,5-furandicarboxylic acid, and 2,5-dimethylfuran. Furfural can undergo several reactions and can give a variety of valuable products due to the presence of the aldehyde group and conjugated system of double bounds in its structure. Furfural is a natural precursor to furan-based chemicals and a major chemical for the production of biofuels and biochemicals.This chapter provides a comprehensive review of the past and present selected relevant commercial and academic technologies that enhance the production of furfural from lignocellulose biomass. It also looks at the production mechanisms to coproduce furfural with other important chemicals, highlighting its chemical properties that enable its utilization in different industrial applications of economic interest. Furfural and its catalytic products also present effective technologies that could increase furfural production yields.},
